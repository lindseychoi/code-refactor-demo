# code-refactor-demo
Homework #1 for DU Bootcamp

This assignment required an existing website to be refactored so that the CSS was condensed and properly working. The HTML also needed editing so that it is considered semantic HTML, instead of being covered in divs. The final criteria was to look at the accessibility standards and incorporate some of those into the code, such as adding alt tags to images and helping with readability.
